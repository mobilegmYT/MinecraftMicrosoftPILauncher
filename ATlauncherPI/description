ATLauncher is a Launcher for Minecraft which integrates multiple different ModPacks to allow you to download and install ModPacks easily and quickly.
To maximize performance and to get solid 60fps, please follow ETA Prime's excellent walkthrough video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqNWJ52DLes
To run: Menu -> Games -> ATlauncher
To run in a terminal: java -jar $HOME/.local/share/ATlauncher/jarfile/launcher.jar

I (pi-dev500) have configured the install script to create a custom ATLauncher.json so you don't have to change settings manually.
