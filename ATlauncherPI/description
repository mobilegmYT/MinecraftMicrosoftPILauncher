Minecraft Java edition for the raspberry pi
To maximize performance and to get solid 60fps, please follow ETA Prime's excellent walkthrough video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqNWJ52DLes
To run: Menu -> Games -> ATlauncher
To run in a terminal: java -jar $HOME/.local/share/ATlauncher/jarfile/launcher.jar

I (pi-dev500) have configured the install script to create a custom ATLauncher.json so you don't have to change settings manually.
